# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

## Overview
This repository contains completed projects from the **Object-Oriented Programming in C++** course, focusing on **structs, linked lists, memory management, and operator overloading**. Each project explores fundamental **data structures and object-oriented programming concepts** through hands-on implementation.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Concepts Implemented**: Structs, Linked Lists, Operator Overloading, Dynamic Memory Allocation
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio
- **Testing & Debugging**: Console-based testing, debugging with step-through execution

---

## 1. Struct-Based Data Storage
Developed a **structured data storage system** using C++ `struct` to manage and retrieve **person records**.

- **Implemented `struct` for complex data types** (Person, Address)
- **Developed file parsing functions** to read structured data from text files
- **Created search functions** for querying names and cities efficiently
- **Used operator overloading** for structured input handling

✔️ Successfully **stored and retrieved structured records**  
✔️ **Efficiently searched & displayed results** based on user queries  

---

## 2. Linked Lists Implementation
Designed and implemented a **doubly linked list** from scratch to manage **dynamic data**.

- **Developed a `linked_list` class** with insertion, deletion, and traversal methods
- **Implemented deep copy constructors** and proper memory management
- **Tested list operations** including merging, sorting, and element retrieval
- **Avoided memory leaks** through careful pointer management

✔️ Built a **fully functional linked list** with **deep copy functionality**  
✔️ Successfully **tested and validated list operations**

## Final Results
- **Implemented and tested essential data structures in C++**
- **Ensured memory-safe operations with proper pointer handling**
- **Applied object-oriented principles for reusable and maintainable code**
- **Verified program correctness with structured testing**
